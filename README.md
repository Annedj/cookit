# Cookit

## A curated list of Restaurant Meal Kits

This project was developed following as much React best-practice and style as possible given our current understanding and appreciation of JavaScript and React. This includes use of ES6+ (const/let, async-await, arrow functions, classes, destructuring), declaration of propTypes and defaultProps, use of functional and class based components as appropriate, use of local env variables, etc.
